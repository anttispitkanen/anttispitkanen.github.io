# My resume, sort of

This is the repo for my sort-of-resume home page hosted at GitHub Pages and live at
[anttipitkanen.com] (https://anttipitkanen.com/).

The original idea was to have something a bit more visual for the introduction
part on my [LinkedIn page] (https://linkedin.com/in/anttispitkanen).

It's built as a very much vanilla single page static site.
Pure HTML5, JavaScript and locally compiled SCSS.
