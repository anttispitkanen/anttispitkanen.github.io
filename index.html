              <h4>Bringing people together</h4>

              <p>
                Currently I'm doing various freelance project work along with studying.
                The projects I'm involved in have mostly to do with marketing, event organizing,
                innovation and communication.
              </p>

              <p>
                Whether it is marketing or innovation it always comes down to bringing people together
                to achieve more together than anyone could on their own.
              </p>

              <p>
                A personal mission of mine is to make the Finnish employment process better.
                I'm a big advocate of being active in job seeking and approaching potential partners
                actively instead of applying to open positions.
              </p>

              <h4>Creating something new</h4>

              <p>
                What I find most exciting is to be involved in creating something new.
                Whether it is a product, a service, an innovation or a discovery, I'm in.
              </p>

              <p>
                "New" doesn't have to be something futuristic and highly technological.
                It can be a new way of utilizing existing things, a new way of bringing
                different talents together or a new way of approaching an old process.
              </p>

              <p>
                To me something is new as long as it is something that creates new value
                and benefit for people.

              <h4>Writing</h4>

              <p>
                Writing is a powerful tool for communicating simple ideas to a broad audience.
                I don't consider myself an excellent writer by any means, but I feel that I can
                get my thoughts across quite efficiently. Besides, I simply like writing as well as reading.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the topics that I've been writing about is how to develop the Finnish
                reqruitment process and how to get right people to meet the right jobs. I've written
                on the subject on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anttispitkanen" target="_blank">Linkedin blog</a>
                and on the <a href="http://uratehdas.fi/blogin-kaikki/398-kukaan-ei-ota-ketaan-toihin-nostamaan-palkkaa"

              For me coding is a way of expressing myself and creating awesome things out of thin air.

              <h4>What I do</h4>

              <p>
                The thing I like most about coding is seeing the outcome in action.
                Starting out with nothing and ending up with something that actually works – what could be better?
              </p>

              <p>
                I like to build things that can be seen and interacted with, which is why I'm
                most into web and front-end development. Having background with business and marketing
                I believe that every solution should exist to serve the user and make the user experience better.
                That's why I'm a big fan of user-centered design.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm also one of the organizers of the <a href="https://twitter.com/TampereJS" target="_blank">TampereJS</a> meetups.

              <h4>My code and stuff</h4>

              <p>
                I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Tampere.
                I spend most of my free time doing small projects, such as
                building web pages (like this one!) and learning about the latest technologies.
              </p>

              <p>
                JavaScript and Node-based technologies are what I like to use most.
                React rocks for UI development. The syntax of Ruby is lovely.

              <img src="images/helloworld.png" alt="Hello world" />

              <p>
                I originally took up coding with the help
                of <a href="https://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and would recommend
                it for anyone wanting to give coding a go.
              </p>

              <p>
                Further resources that helped me a lot were
                <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>,
                <a href="https://leveluptutorials.com/" target="_blank">Level Up Tutorials</a>,
                <a href="https://www.devwalks.com/" target="_blank">devwalks</a> and
                <a href="http://mooc.fi/" target="_blank">mooc.fi</a>,
                and I would recommend those to anyone wanting to start learning.
              </p>

              <p>
                For the design side of things I really enjoy the approach
                of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners" target="_blank">DevTips</a>.

              <h4>Motivation and purpose</h4>

              <p>
                The most crucial thing for one's wellbeing is doing things that matter to you.
                People have the capacity to spend enormous amounts of effort on doing things
                they care about and find interesting. So why do people work jobs they don't want to,
                in working environments where they are treated badly and not motivated?
              </p>

              <p>
                The whole society would be so much more efficient if people were able to use
                their effort doing things they feel motivated about. That doesn't mean however that
                everyone should quit their jobs and start doing something completely different.
              </p>

              <p>
                It means that companies should do everything in their power to make their employees
                feel appreciated and supported in what they do. It also means that every employee should spend
                some time thinking about their own wants and needs.
              </p>

              <p>
                When applying for a job it's crucial to apply to a job you want to work on,
                to a company you want to work in and to a greater cause that you want to work towards.
              </p>

              <p>
                I am a big advocate of positive psychology, happiness and mindfullness.

              <h4>Exercise</h4>

              <img src="images/yoga.jpg" alt="Doing yoga" />

              <p>
                Wellbeing is obviously also about the physical aspect. Taking care of just the mind is
                not enough.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm very interested in the way the human musculoskeletal system works. I have studied many
                aspects of physiotherapy and functional movement and try to continuously apply that knowledge
                to myself.
              </p>

              <p>
                The goal is to keep the body functional and healthy. The solution is to both strengthen the
                muscles and make the joints and other ligaments more mobile. The tool is to exercise in diverse
                ways with knowledge on what to do and how.
              </p>

              <p>
                I mostly enjoy yoga-like mobility work and bodyweight based workouts. Lately I have tried some
                street workout and found it very engaging.
              </p>

              <p>
                Besides taking care of myself I try to spread the knowledge and help people feel physically
                better by advising them on correct working ergonomy, posture and movement mechanics.

              <h4>Exploring nature</h4>

              <img src="images/nature2.jpg" alt="Moving in nature" />

              <p>
                Being in the middle of nature has many benefits in and of itself. Think of a forest or
                a lakeside: the tranquility, fresh air and calming view. While just being in nature is
                good for you, the benefits really come to full effect when you add moving to the equation.
              </p>

              <p>
                Running on a trail, jumping on rocks or climbing trees requires you to really concentrate
                on what you are doing. The resulting movement is versatile and challenging but you get
                the added benefit of mindfulness as well.
              </p>

              <p>
                Movement that requires a lot of coordination is optimal in making your mind focuse on
                one thing. That gives the brain a break from the everyday multitasking. It forces you
                to really use your senses and live in the moment. And that is a good thing.

              <p>
                Making music is a way of expressing myself and satisfying my need to create something new.
                It is much like coding: you start out with nothing and end up with something great.
              </p>

              <p>
                I make my own music under the alias Poetkoe. I do everything myself:
                composing, arrangin, producing, playing, programming, mixing, mastering...
              </p>

              <p>
                The musical styles of Poetkoe range from prog-rock to rap and house and everything in between.

              <img src="images/guitar.jpg" alt="Playing guitar" />

              <p>
                I have been playing gigs for a number of years in different groups and venues.
                The gigs range from solo performances with vocals and guitar or piano
                to full band party shows and everything in between.
              </p>

              <p>
                What I find most interesting about playing live is improvisation: the need to stay focused and ready
                to adapt to changing situations. A request from the audience can take the whole show
                to a new direction. Playing with a group of people is the ultimate form of teamwork
                and communication, and playing with new people is always different and exciting.
              </p>

              <p>
                Singing is most of the times my main duty on a gig. I also play the guitar, bass
                and keys depending on what is needed. Playing different instruments at different times
                keeps it even more interesting, since playing a gig can be quite different with a different
                instrument.

            <p>
              <br/>These are some of the communities I'm involved in:

              <h4>TampereJS</h4>
              <img src="images/tamperejs2.jpg" alt="TampereJS" />

              <p>
                TampereJS is a community of JavaScript and web-development oriented people in Tampere.
                We organize meetups once a month with companies as sponsors.
                The community is completely volunteer based and the events are free to attend.
              </p>

              <p>
                I volunteered as an organizer for three reasons. First of all I want to learn as much
                as possible about web development and JavaScript, and what would be a more engaging way.
                Secondly, I want to create myself a vast network of IT people and companies, and where would that
                be easier. Thirdly, I saw an opportunity for being active in creating something new
                for the Tampere IT scene. For me it's a win-win-win.
              </p>

              <p>
                Check TampereJS out and come attend our meetups!

              <h4>TreStart</h4>
              <img src="images/trestart.jpg" alt="TreStart" />
              <p>
                TreStart is a community under the city of Tampere where talented people meet
                local companies to network and to create new business.
              </p>

              <p>
                The services of TreStart are mainly targeted on one hand to highly educated unemployed people,
                or talents as we call them, and on the other hand to growing companies in the Tampere region.
                I first found out about TreStart and attended their events when I was unemployed myself.
                Through the events and actions I got to complete interesting projects with local companies
                and grow my professional networks with loads of potential employers, business partners
                and various talents.
              </p>

              <p>
                I have gotten much out of attending TreStart events and now I want to help out the
                community which ever way I can. I still attend all the events possible and try to
                share my thoughts and tips on job seeking, personal branding and networking.

              <h4>Virtual Reality Finland</h4>
              <img src="images/vrfinland.jpg" alt="VR Finland" />
              <p>
                VR Finland is an association that supports the development of VR and AR ecosystems in Finland.
                The goal is to help Finland become the leading player in VR and AR technologies.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now that VR and AR are becoming more known and popular I want to be in the frontlines.
              </p>

              <p>
                I've joined Virtual Reality Finland fairly recently, but I have already attended several events
                and even helped organize one.
