              <p>
                Currently I'm doing various freelance project work along with studying.
                The projects I'm involved in have mostly to do with marketing, event organizing,
                innovation and communication.
              </p>

              <p>
                Whether it is marketing or innovation it always comes down to bringing people together.
              </p>

              <p>
                A personal mission of mine is to make the Finnish employment process better.
                I'm a big advocate of being active in job seeking and approaching potential partners
                actively instead of applying to open positions.

              <h4>What I do</h4>

              <p>
                The thing I like most about coding is seeing the outcome in action.
                Starting out with nothing and ending up with something that actually works – what could be better?
              </p>

              <p>
                I like to build things that can be seen and interacted with, which is why I'm
                most into web and front-end development. Having background with business and marketing
                I believe that every solution should exist to serve the user and make the user experience better.
                That's why I'm a big fan of user-centered design.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm also one of the organizers of the <a href="https://twitter.com/TampereJS" target="_blank">TampereJS</a> meetups.

              <h4>My code and stuff</h4>

              <p>
                I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Tampere.
                I spend most of my free time doing small projects, such as
                building web pages (like this one!) and learning about the latest technologies.
              </p>

              <p>
                JavaScript and Node-based technologies are what I like to use most.
                React rocks for UI development. The syntax of Ruby is lovely.
                Who wants to write CSS with SASS available?

            <div class="info-item">
              <h4>Where I started</h4>

              <p>
                I originally took up coding with the help
                of <a href="https://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and would recommend
                it for anyone wanting to give coding a go.
              </p>

              <p>
                Further resources that helped me a lot were
                <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>,
                <a href="https://leveluptutorials.com/" target="_blank">Level Up Tutorials</a>,
                <a href="https://www.devwalks.com/" target="_blank">devwalks</a> and
                <a href="http://mooc.fi/" target="_blank">mooc.fi</a>,
                and I would recommend those to anyone wanting to start learning.
              </p>

              <p>
                For the design side of things I really enjoy the approach
                of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners" target="_blank">DevTips</a>.

              <p>
                Making music is a way of expressing myself and satisfying my need to create something new.
                It is much like coding: you start out with nothing and end up with something great.
              </p>

              <p>
                I make my own music under the alias Poetkoe. I do everything myself:
                composing, arrangin, producing, playing, programming, mixing, mastering...
              </p>

              <p>
                The musical styles of Poetkoe range from prog-rock to rap and house and everything in between.

              <h4>Solo &amp; Band</h4>
              <img src="images/guitar.jpg" alt="Playing guitar" />

              <p>
                I have been playing gigs for a number of years in different groups and venues.
                The gigs range from solo performances with vocals and guitar or piano
                to full band party shows and everything in between.
              </p>

              <p>
                What I find most interesting about playing live is improvisation: the need to stay focused and ready
                to adapt to changing situations. A request from the audience can take the whole show
                to a new direction. Playing with a group of people is the ultimate form of teamwork
                and communication, and playing with new people is always different and exciting.
              </p>

              <p>
                Singing is most of the times my main duty on a gig. I also play the guitar, bass
                and keys depending on what is needed. Playing different instruments at different times
                keeps it even more interesting, since playing a gig can be quite different with a different
                instrument.

                TampereJS is a community of JavaScript and web-development oriented people in Tampere.
                We organize meetups once a month with companies as sponsors.

              </p>

              <p>
                I volunteered as an organizer for three reasons. First of all I want to learn as much
                as possible about web development and JavaScript, and what would be a more engaging way.
                Secondly, I want to create myself a vast network of IT people and companies, and where would that
                be easier. Thirdly, I saw an opportunity for being active in creating something new
                for the Tampere IT scene. For me it's a win-win-win.

                TreStart is a community under the city of Tampere where talented people meet

              </p>

              <p>
                The services of TreStart are mainly targeted on one hand to highly educated unemployed people,
                or talents as we call them, and on the other hand to growing companies in the Tampere region.
                I first found out about TreStart and attended their events when I was unemployed myself.
                Through the events and actions I got to complete interesting projects with local companies
                and grow my professional networks with loads of potential employers, business partners
                and various talents.
              </p>

              <p>
                I have gotten much out of attending TreStart events and now I want to help out the
                community which ever way I can. I still attend all the events possible and try to
                share my thoughts and tips on job seeking, personal branding and networking.
